Spherical simulations show depth-dependent potential decay; realistic models reveal Î¼V gradients and asymmetries. 10mm shifts cause pronounced errors (avg ~0.005mm), histograms with central peaks; 5mm reduces magnitude. Conductivity changes distort localization. Realistic models outperform spherical for accuracy.
